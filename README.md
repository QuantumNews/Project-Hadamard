# Project-Hadamard
The Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) project developed a platform that enabled dynamic portfolio optimization using quantum annealing. This use case demonstrated how quantum algorithms can be integrated into financial decision-making, optimizing asset allocation by efficiently solving complex optimization problems on real quantum hardware.
